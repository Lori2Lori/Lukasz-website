Couple months ago I've talked to my friend Tomek (who happens to be IT manager, public speaker and a personal coach as well) and I've decided I want to recognize people who inspire me to action. I want it, because as Nelson Mandela rightly pointed out: *"some things seem to be impossible until their done"*.

I've wanted to write such post for a long time but stuck with thought that it has to be perfect.

Things changed yesterday when I was listening Jonathan's Cutrell Developer Tea podcast [How To Make Small Things A Big Deal, Plus: Celebrating 2 Million Listens!](https://developertea.com/episodes/19955) I realized, that great things are made of small ones. None of great things were achieved in one day.

Of course many people many people inspire me, but the first post from this series is about **Jonathan Cutrell**, whose podcast pushed me to action today. He is a Web Developer and creates short podcasts on programming topics. As far as I know, he publish one podcast every two days, which is an amazing achievement. I listen to them when I can't do anything else. It takes only 10 minutes -  waiting for the bus, making breakfast or in the evening when I'm already too tired to listen other one-and-a-half-hour-long podcasts.

He sees an opportunity where other people don't. That's why I recommend his podcasts, especially to beginners in a moments of doubt :)

You can listen to him at [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/).
