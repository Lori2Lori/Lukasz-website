#About this webpage

On this website I'd like to share my experience with learning programming, especially web development and design. Currently I'm a lawyer who wants to become front-end developer. I'm learning Graphic Design at school and programming from the internet, free courses and from my friends.

I have ambitious goal to make this website totally from scratch, so I'm not using here any pre-build CMS. I will be experimenting with better and worse features.

I'm open to suggestions about improving this website, feel free to contact me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/Lori2Lori) and visit me at [GitHub](https://github.com/Lori2Lori).
